# OAP-Cache

OAP-Cache is an optimized plug-in package designed to accelerate Spark SQL\* performance by using index and cache technology. Indexing can improve Spark interactive query performance by as much as an order of magnitude, and caching delivers additional Spark SQL query performance benefits. We support both DRAM and Intel® Optane™ DC Persistent Memory Module as cache media.
