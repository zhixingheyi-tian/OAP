## Prerequisites 
To enable Shuffle Remote PMem extension, you must configure and validate RDMA in advance, you can refer to [Shuffle Remote PMem Extension Guide](../oap-shuffle/RPMem-shuffle/README.md) for more details.

Some dependencies required by OAP listed below, to enable OAP, you must install all of them on your cluster nodes.
- [Cmake](https://help.directadmin.com/item.php?id=494)
- [Memkind](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/memkind)
- [Vmemcache](https://github.com/pmem/vmemcache)
- [HPNL](https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/HPNL)
- [PMDK](https://github.com/pmem/pmdk)  
- [GCC > 7](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/InstallingGCC)

####  Install prerequisites 
You can refer to the corresponding documents to install prerequisites by yourself. If your system is Fedora 29 or Centos 7, we have provided a shell script named prepare_oap_env.sh to install all these dependencies.

```shell script
export ENABLE_RDMA=true
source $OAP_HOME/dev/prepare_oap_env.sh
prepare_all
```

If you need't RDMA, just run following command.
```shell script
source $OAP_HOME/dev/prepare_oap_env.sh
prepare_all
```
If you only want to use specified module of OAP, you can refer to the corresponding user guide. Some functions to install prerequisites for OAP have been integrated into this prepare_oap_env.sh, you can use command like prepare_cmake to install the specified dependencies after executing the command "source prepare_oap_env.sh". Use the following command to learn more.  
```shell script
oap_build_help
```
If there are any problems during the automatic installation process, we recommend you to refer to the relevant documentation of the dependency, and then install it by yourself.


### Compiling OAP
If you have installed all prerequisites, you can use make-distribution.sh to generate all jars under the dictionary $OAP_HOME/dev/release-package.
```shell script
sh $OAP_HOME/dev/make-distribution.sh
``````
If you only want to use specified module of OAP, you can use the command like the following, and then you should find the jar under the dictionary of the module.
```shell script
mvn clean -pl com.intel.oap:oap-cache -am package
```

###  Configuration
To enable the module which you want to use, please refer to the corresponding documents for the introduction and how to use the feature.
